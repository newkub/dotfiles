Review Guidelines

Is it type-safe?

Are there any duplicates?

Are the dependencies appropriate and necessary?

Prefer modern, fast, ESM-compatible dependencies.

Is the error handling sufficient and robust?

Use Effect-TS (or similar effect systems) for consistent and type-safe error handling.

Does it follow the single responsibility principle?

Are there any performance issues?

Is the naming clear and consistent?

Is the project structure/organization well-arranged?

Can it scale as the project grows?

Is the code readable and easy to understand?

The file is too long. Can we refactor it by splitting into separate files?

ðŸ‘‰ If you see something that should be done, just do it without asking.
