# Dependency Analysis and Selection Workflow

> **Before diving into dependency selection, always start with understanding your project's fundamental goals and requirements.**

## **üéØ Prerequisites: Foundation Analysis**

### **Step 1: Analyze Project Goals** üìã
Before selecting any dependencies, thoroughly understand:
- **Project Purpose**: What core problem does this solve?
- **Target Audience**: Who will use this and how?
- **Success Metrics**: How will you measure success?
- **Technical Constraints**: Performance, security, scalability requirements?

> **Use**: `@analyze-project-goal` workflow to systematically evaluate project requirements.

### **Step 2: Review Documentation** üìö
Examine existing project documentation:
- **README.md**: Current project description and setup instructions
- **package.json**: Existing dependencies and project configuration
- **Contributing Guidelines**: Development standards and processes
- **Architecture Decisions**: Technical choices already made

> **Use**: `@update-readme` workflow to ensure documentation is current before dependency decisions.

### **Step 3: Assess Current State** üîç
- **Bundle Analysis**: What's the current bundle size and performance?
- **Tech Stack**: What frameworks and tools are already in use?
- **Team Expertise**: What technologies does the team know well?
- **Project Stage**: Is this a new project, refactor, or feature addition?

## **‚ö° Only Then: Dependency Selection**

Once you have a solid understanding of your project's goals, constraints, and current state, proceed with dependency analysis using the guidelines below.

Dependency Analysis and Selection Guidelines

## **üìä Comprehensive Dependencies Reference**

> **üéØ Purpose**: This curated collection of 200+ modern dependencies across 25 categories provides a comprehensive toolkit for informed decision-making. Each package includes detailed analysis of bundle impact, community adoption, and ESM compatibility.

> **üí° Usage Tips**:
> - **Start Small**: Begin with essential categories (Build Tools, Runtime, Validation)
> - **Bundle Conscious**: Prioritize packages with smaller bundle sizes for better performance
> - **ESM First**: Prefer packages with full ESM support for modern development
> - **Community Driven**: Higher star ratings indicate better maintenance and community support
> - **UnoCSS Integration**: Styling recommendations prioritize UnoCSS for optimal developer experience

> **üîç Analysis Framework**:
> 1. **Identify Need**: What specific problem are you solving?
> 2. **Compare Options**: Use this table to evaluate alternatives
> 3. **Bundle Impact**: Consider performance implications
> 4. **Team Fit**: Ensure compatibility with existing tech stack
> 5. **Future Maintenance**: Choose well-maintained, actively developed packages

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes**:
> - Bundle sizes are approximate and may vary based on usage
> - ESM support levels: ‚úÖ Full = Native ESM, ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial = Mixed support, ‚ùå CommonJS = Legacy only
> - Popularity based on npm downloads, GitHub stars, and community adoption
> - Always check latest versions and security advisories before adding dependencies
